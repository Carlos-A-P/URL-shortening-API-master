### What I learned

In this challenge I used the a javascript code from Website [CodePen Home Flip Clock & Countdown](https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/vKzoLL) which is a clock made without a HTML so I mainly focused on prioritizing my CSS and changing styles using Devtools. I also added a few changes to the javascript to remove the second timer.

```HTML

```

-

```CSS

```
